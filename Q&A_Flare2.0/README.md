# NVIDIA_FLARE

1. Is it possible to run 2 experiments at the same time? 

No, Flare (below 2.1) does not support this option. When trying to run 2 experiments, one will get an error "Server already starting or started". One needs to wait till the current experiment finishes, then an app can be launched.
